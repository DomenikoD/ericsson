# Robust test automation framework

## 1. Selecting Automation Tools and Technologies
Frontend Testing: Given that the front end is developed in Vue.js, tools like Selenium library in Python would be good for manipulate HTML elements.
API Testing: For testing Spring Boot APIs, Postman for manual testing and to generate test scripts for the automation and integration into CI/CD pipelines.
Performance and Security Testing: Tools in Kali Linux (nmap, owas zap, Burp...) can be used to simulate load on the application and for the basic penetration tests.

## 2. Framework Design and Architecture
Modular Design: Structure the framework in a way that separates test plans, test sets, test cases, data input, test configuration and test results.
Data-Driven Approach: External data sources (like Excel, CSV, or JSON files, DBs) to drive test cases and make them reusable.

## 3. Test Coverage and Prioritization
Test Coverage: Ensure that all features such as browsing products, adding them to cart, and checkout processes are covered.
Prioritization: Test critical paths in early stages of development. Prioritize tests that cover the most common usage scenatious and critical functionalities of the web application.

## 4. Integration with the Development Process (CI/CD)
Continuous Integration: Integrate into the GIT hooks/actions to run the tests on every commit and pull request. Set of the regression - automated tests.

## 5. Maintenance and Scalability of Automated Tests
Refactoring and Optimization: Regularly review and refactor tests to improve execution time and increase robustness.

## 6. Handling of Dynamic Web Elements and Asynchronous Operations
Use Python wait time function with fixed sleeps and multiple retryes to handle asynchronous behavior and dynamic content what is not so efficiently, or use tools with image inspection features like Ranorex.

## 7. Reporting and Monitoring of Test Results
TMS - monitoring test execution and creation of the test report.

## 8. Mentoring the Team and Upskilling
Training sessions and workshops to help manual testers to upskill in automated testing, regular weekly time slots dedicated for learning.
Knowledge sharing through regular unofficial meetings and Confluence or Wiki documentation.
